 Magento 2 bReviews Extension
==========================

This extension adds features to your Magento 2 store at product review page!
With this extension you can see total score of reviews and review score summary. It removes nickname section in a add review form but extension takes customer name and put it instead (if guest send review it will put "Guest" instead of username).
It supports full page caching because dynamic objects are not cacheable!
 
## Requirements

```
Magento 2.0+
```

## How to install

Installation is easy. You can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) or you can put all files from GitHub direcly to your folders. In your code folder create two more folders "Matej\bReviews" and run command:
```php bin/magento setup:upgrade ```. Your folder structure should look like this:
```
app/code/
├── Matej/
│   │   ├──bReviews/
│   │   │   ├── ...
│   │   │   ├── ...
```

## Note
This code is pretty much automate without admin code because this code is made by young developer at his internship at [Inchoo](http://www.inchoo.net/) coding in Magento 2 framework for a 2 weeks. This code is practice for this framework and it may not work like you expect nor have good practice code like in professional extensions!
Thanks for looking at this extension! =)
